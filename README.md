# ueyecam
An object-oriented code wrapper used to access the uEyeCam directly from MATLAB.

# Installation
The code relies on the DLLs delivered with the uEyeCam software. Please download the software package / driver package for your camera from [IDS Imaging](https://de.ids-imaging.com).

Before getting started with the MATLAB version of the code, please make sure that the camera itself works using the uEye Cockpit application.
